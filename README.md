# Welcome to Ask the Zebra

It is one of my first aproachs into using mySQL.

# lab

It is a php page where i tried to store all the process into understanding how it works. From then on, the improvements.

# Two different sites into one

One is how i ended up understanding the concepts :

index.php
header.php
q1.php
q2.php
q3.php
result.php

The other is the efficient way of doing it

question.php
result2.php
php/data-collector.php
php/header2.php
php/db.php
